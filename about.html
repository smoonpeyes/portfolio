                <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; opacity: 0.85;">I'm a Principal UX Designer with over 20 years of experience building accessible, inclusive digital products. I believe great design isn't just about solving today's problems—it's about creating systems that last.</p>

        <!-- About Content -->
        <section class="container-narrow">
            <div class="about-content">
                <div class="about-text">
                    <h2>In brief</h2>
                    <p>For over two decades, I've designed memorable products and experiences that make people's lives easier. I've evolved into an end-to-end product designer focused on solving real problems. I bring exceptional accessibility expertise, systems thinking, and storytelling to my craft.</p>
                    
                    <h2>What I do</h2>
                    <p>I specialize in designing complex digital products that need to work for diverse audiences. Whether it's building an accessibility program from the ground up at HEB, designing internal apps for Southwest Airlines flight crews, or reimagining how families shop for groceries, I bring a thoughtful, inclusive approach to every project.</p>
                    
                    <p>My work spans:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Accessibility programs and inclusive design systems</li>
                        <li>Enterprise and internal tool design</li>
                        <li>Consumer-facing digital products</li>
                        <li>Design leadership and mentorship</li>
                        <li>Cross-functional collaboration and stakeholder management</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2>How I work</h2>
                    <p>I believe the best design comes from deep understanding—of users, business constraints, technical realities, and team dynamics. I'm comfortable moving between strategic thinking and hands-on design work. I ask hard questions, advocate for users who often get overlooked, and build relationships across functions to ship great products.</p>
                    
                    <p>I currently run design reviews, mentor other designers, and approve work at Amdocs Studios. I've been curious about moving into formal design management because I love helping designers grow and building strong, collaborative teams.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Beyond design</h2>
                    <p>When I'm not designing, you'll find me:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Writing TV pilots:</strong> I write in my spare time and have completed two pilots. Currently revising one and planning the next.</li>
                        <li><strong>Drumming:</strong> I play drums in an all-women surf rock band in Austin.</li>
                        <li><strong>Trail running:</strong> I just finished the Sky Island 25k in September. There's something about the endurance and problem-solving of long trail runs that mirrors how I approach design challenges.</li>
                        <li><strong>Living in Austin:</strong> Originally from Louisiana, I love Austin's creative energy and commitment to keeping things weird.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2>Career highlights</h2>
                    <p><strong>Amdocs Studios (2022-Present)</strong><br>
                    Principal Designer working on internal applications for Southwest Airlines flight attendants and pilots. Translating complex operational and regulatory requirements into intuitive mobile experiences.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>HEB Digital (2018-2022)</strong><br>
                    Started and led HEB's digital accessibility program, ensuring millions of Texans could access their online grocery shopping and digital services. Also worked on coupons, shopping lists, and new market expansions. This is the work I'm most proud of—building something from nothing that genuinely helps people.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Various agencies and in-house teams (2002-2018)</strong><br>
                    Spent nearly two decades designing for clients across industries—retail, healthcare, finance, and technology. Learned how to adapt my approach to different contexts while maintaining a commitment to accessibility and user-centered design.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Let's connect</h2>
                    <p>I'm currently exploring new opportunities, particularly design manager roles where I can combine hands-on design work with team leadership. If you're building something meaningful and need someone who designs for the long run, I'd love to hear from you.</p>

                        <h3>I'm a builder of foundations...</h3>
                        <p>I don't just design products—I build the infrastructure that makes good design possible at scale. At HEB, I started the digital accessibility program from scratch. I know how to identify gaps, make the case for investment, and create systems that outlast any single project. I care about leaving things better than I found them.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="differentiator">
                        <h3>I'm a translator...</h3>
                        <p>I spent 20+ years moving between highly technical stakeholders (pilots, flight attendants, engineers) and everyday users (grocery shoppers, families). I can take complex regulatory requirements or business constraints and turn them into intuitive experiences. No jargon, no confusion—just clarity.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="differentiator">
                        <h3>I'm a drummer...</h3>
                        <p>When you're the drummer in a band, you're not the star—you're the backbone. You set the tempo, you keep everyone together, and if you mess up, the whole song falls apart. I bring that same energy to design: I know when to lead, when to support, and how to keep a team in sync even when things get chaotic.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="differentiator">
                        <h3>I'm a runner...</h3>
                        <p>Trail running teaches you that the path is never as straightforward as you think. There are switchbacks, obstacles, and moments where you question why you're doing this at all. But you keep moving forward, you adapt to the terrain, and you celebrate when you reach the summit. That's how I approach complex design challenges—with endurance, adaptability, and an eye on the long game.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="differentiator">
                        <h3>I'm a storyteller...</h3>
                        <p>Before I was a designer, I wanted to be a screenwriter (still do, honestly). That training taught me that everything is about the narrative: Why does this button matter? What's the user's emotional journey? How do we make stakeholders care? I bring that storytelling lens to everything—from design critiques to executive presentations.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="differentiator">
                        <h3>I'm an advocate...</h3>
                        <p>I've been the one in the room saying "but what about accessibility?" or "have we thought about edge cases?" for my entire career. Good design doesn't just work for the happy path—it works for everyone, including the people who get forgotten. I don't just check boxes; I genuinely care about inclusive design because everyone deserves to be picked for the team of life.</p>
