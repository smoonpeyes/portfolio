                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>When I joined HEB Digital in 2018, the company had ambitious goals for their digital transformation, but accessibility wasn't yet part of the conversation. With millions of Texans relying on HEB for groceries—including people with disabilities, aging populations, and those with temporary impairments—we had a responsibility to make our digital products work for everyone.</p>
                
                <p>The challenge wasn't just technical. It was cultural, organizational, and systemic:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No existing accessibility standards or guidelines for designers and engineers</li>
                    <li>Limited awareness across teams about why accessibility mattered</li>
                    <li>No tools or processes for testing and validating accessibility</li>
                    <li>Fast-paced development cycles that often left accessibility as an afterthought</li>
                    <li>Legacy code and design patterns that needed remediation</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            
            <!-- Approach Section -->
            <section class="case-study-section">
                <h2>My Approach</h2>
                <p>I knew that sustainable change required more than just fixing individual products. We needed to build accessibility into the foundation of how HEB Digital worked. My approach focused on three key areas:</p>
                
                <h3>1. Building awareness and empathy</h3>
                <p>Before anyone would invest time or resources into accessibility, they needed to understand why it mattered. I organized workshops where team members experienced the web using only a keyboard, screen reader, or with visual impairments simulated. I shared stories from real HEB customers who struggled with our digital products.</p>
                
                <p>The goal wasn't to shame anyone—it was to create genuine empathy and make accessibility personal. When engineers realized their own parents might struggle with the checkout flow, accessibility stopped being a compliance checkbox and became a priority.</p>
                
                <h3>2. Creating systems and standards</h3>
                <p>I developed HEB's first accessibility design guidelines, covering:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Color contrast requirements and approved color combinations</li>
                    <li>Typography and text sizing standards</li>
                    <li>Touch target sizing for mobile interfaces</li>
                    <li>Keyboard navigation patterns</li>
                    <li>Screen reader considerations and ARIA best practices</li>
                    <li>Form design and error handling</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>These weren't theoretical documents—they were practical, actionable guides that designers could reference during every project. I also created Sketch/Figma components with accessibility built in, making it easier to do the right thing by default.</p>
                
                <h3>3. Integrating accessibility into workflows</h3>
                <p>Good intentions aren't enough without process. I worked with product managers and engineering leads to embed accessibility into our sprint cycles:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Added accessibility checkpoints to our definition of done</li>
                    <li>Trained designers to conduct basic accessibility audits</li>
                    <li>Set up automated testing tools to catch common issues early</li>
                    <li>Created a review process where I audited high-priority features</li>
                    <li>Established relationships with accessibility consultants for third-party audits</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Key Projects</h2>
                <p>While building the program, I also led accessibility improvements across several products:</p>
                
                <div class="case-study-grid">
                    <div class="case-study-card">
                        <h4>Shopping & Checkout</h4>
                        <p>Redesigned the cart and checkout flow with keyboard navigation, clear error messaging, and screen reader support. Reduced checkout abandonment for assistive technology users by 34%.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="case-study-card">
                        <h4>Coupons & Lists</h4>
                        <p>Made digital coupons and shopping lists fully accessible, including improved contrast ratios, larger touch targets, and better focus indicators. These features are among the most-used in the app.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="case-study-card">
                        <h4>Account Management</h4>
                        <p>Overhauled forms across the account section, implementing clear labels, helpful error messages, and better keyboard navigation. Improved form completion rates across all users.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="case-study-card">
                        <h4>Search & Browse</h4>
                        <p>Enhanced product search and category browsing with better ARIA labels, keyboard shortcuts, and screen reader announcements for dynamic content updates.</p>

                <h3>Impact & Results</h3>
                <p>By the time I left HEB in 2022, accessibility had gone from an afterthought to a core part of how the team worked:</p>
                
                <div class="impact-stats">
                    <div class="stat">
                        <span class="stat-number">WCAG 2.1 AA</span>
                        <span class="stat-label">Compliance achieved</span>
                    </div>
                    <div class="stat">
                        <span class="stat-number">40+</span>
                        <span class="stat-label">Team members trained</span>

                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">More importantly, we received heartfelt feedback from customers who previously couldn't shop online independently. One customer wrote to thank us because she could finally order groceries for her family without asking for help—a small change for us, but a huge impact on her dignity and independence.</p>

            <!-- Reflection Section -->
            <section class="case-study-section">
                <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                <p>This project taught me that building lasting change requires more than design skills—it requires advocacy, patience, and systems thinking. Some key lessons:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Empathy is contagious:</strong> When you help people understand the human impact of accessibility, they become champions too.</li>
                    <li><strong>Make the right thing easy:</strong> Creating accessible design components and clear guidelines reduced friction and made accessibility the path of least resistance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Start with quick wins:</strong> Early successes (like fixing color contrast issues) built momentum and credibility for bigger initiatives.</li>
                    <li><strong>Measure what matters:</strong> Tracking completion rates and user feedback was more persuasive than theoretical arguments about compliance.</li>
                    <li><strong>It's never "done":</strong> Accessibility is an ongoing practice, not a one-time project. The program I started continues to evolve today.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>This is the work I'm most proud of from my time at HEB. Not because it was technically complex, but because it genuinely helped people and created a foundation that will benefit millions of Texans for years to come.</p>
