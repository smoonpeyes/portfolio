            I’m a design leader with 20+ years of experience building
            accessible, inclusive digital experiences. I believe great design
            endures. It connects people, scales gracefully, and stands the test
            of time.

            <h2>In Brief</h2>
            <p>
              With 20+ years of experience in service design, product design,
              accessibility, and user research, I help organizations create
              thoughtful, inclusive products that improve lives at scale.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've worked across industries -- from retail and healthcare to
              enterprise and transportation -- leading teams, shaping process,
              and embedding accessibility into every stage of product
              development. I believe good design is not only about solving
              problems, but also about building trust, clarity, and connection.
            </p>

            <h2>What I Do Best</h2>

            <h3>Systems Thinker & Experience Architect</h3>

            <p>
              I’m especially good at untangling complex systems and translating
              them into simple, intuitive experiences.
            </p>

            <h3>Inclusive Design Advocate</h3>
            <p>
              I build practices and culture around accessibility—not as a
              checklist, but as a shared responsibility.
            </p>

            <h3>Team Builder & Mentor</h3>
            <p>
              Whether I’m leading designers or cross-functional teams, I help
              people do the best work of their lives and feel seen in the
              process.
            </p>

            <h2>What Makes Me Me</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                I bring a calm, grounded presence to high-pressure environments,
                balancing empathy with clarity and momentum.
              </li>
              <li>
                Creativity shows up in my work and in life: I’m also a drummer
                and songwriter in a band, a trail runner, and a lifelong learner
                continually exploring design, rhythm, and meaning.
              </li>
              <li>
                I believe joy, curiosity, and spaciousness bring out the best in
                people (and the best in design).
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Values I Live & Work By</h2>
            <p>When I'm not designing, you'll find me:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Design with generosity</li>
              <li>Details matter, but people matter more</li>
              <li>Accessibility and inclusion are non-negotiable</li>
              <li>Good systems free people up to be creative</li>
              <li>Make things that hold up in the real world</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Outside Work</h2>
            <p>
              I perform and record with my band, The Sea Hagzzz, where I hold
              down the drums and experiment with stage presence. I trail run in
              the Texas hills. I geek out over sound, symbolism, and
              storytelling. I’m always chasing connection, purpose, and that
              feeling of being fully alive.
            </p>

            <h2>Let's connect</h2>
            <p>
              I'm currently exploring new opportunities, particularly design
              roles where I can combine hands-on design work with team
              leadership. If you're building something meaningful and need
              someone who designs for the long run, I'd love to hear from you.

          <h2>My Differentiators</h2>

          <div class="differentiators-grid">
            <div class="differentiator">
              <h3>I'm a builder of foundations...</h3>
              <p>
                I don't just design products—I build the infrastructure that
                makes good design possible at scale. At HEB, I started the
                digital accessibility program from scratch. I know how to
                identify gaps, make the case for investment, and create systems
                that outlast any single project. I care about leaving things
                better than I found them.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="differentiator">
              <h3>I'm a translator...</h3>
              <p>
                I spent 20+ years moving between highly technical stakeholders
                (pilots, flight attendants, engineers) and everyday users
                (grocery shoppers, families). I can take complex regulatory
                requirements or business constraints and turn them into
                intuitive experiences. No jargon, no confusion—just clarity.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="differentiator">
              <h3>I'm a drummer...</h3>
              <p>
                When you're the drummer in a band, you're not the star—you're
                the backbone. You set the tempo, you keep everyone together, and
                if you mess up, the whole song falls apart. I bring that same
                energy to design: I know when to lead, when to support, and how
                to keep a team in sync even when things get chaotic.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="differentiator">
              <h3>I'm a runner...</h3>
              <p>
                Trail running teaches you that the path is never as
                straightforward as you think. There are switchbacks, obstacles,
                and moments where you question why you're doing this at all. But
                you keep moving forward, you adapt to the terrain, and you
                celebrate when you reach the summit. That's how I approach
                complex design challenges—with endurance, adaptability, and an
                eye on the long game.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="differentiator">
              <h3>I'm a storyteller...</h3>
              <p>
                Before I was a designer, I wanted to be a screenwriter (still
                do, honestly). That training taught me that everything is about
                the narrative: Why does this button matter? What's the user's
                emotional journey? How do we make stakeholders care? I bring
                that storytelling lens to everything—from design critiques to
                executive presentations.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="differentiator">
              <h3>I'm an advocate...</h3>
              <p>
                I've been the one in the room saying "but what about
                accessibility?" or "have we thought about edge cases?" for my
                entire career. Good design doesn't just work for the happy
                path—it works for everyone, including the people who get
                forgotten. I don't just check boxes; I genuinely care about
                inclusive design because everyone deserves to be picked for the
                team of life.
